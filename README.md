#### Web app to make conversions between different numerical systems.


## The Project

I create this project to master my javascript skills and made a simpler and nicer UI design than others websites.

Is built with pure Javascript and has a simple structure.

I just finished the project implementing two numerical systems: **Binary and Decimal.**

The idea is to implement more numerical systems conversions by the dev community. So, if you want to help and contribute check the guide below.
